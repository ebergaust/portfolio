        This is an introductory page where I describe myself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The name is Erik Bergaust, was born in the USA but have spent my entire life internationally, living in countries like El Salvador, Morocco, Indonesia, Panama, and Ecuador. 
        This diverse upbringing has given me a rich and varied perspective on the world. 
        Currently, I'm in college with no apparent major, and my hobbies include drawing, building Gundam model sets, and world building, reflecting my creative and meticulous nature. 
        My love for the outdoors is evident in my passion for camping and mountaineering, while my enthusiasm for almost all sports showcases my active and adventurous spirit. 
        My unique experiences and interests have shaped me into a well-rounded and culturally enriched individual.

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        This is the main project page where all of my current or previous projects be it art, writing, music, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, working on projects, whether in art, writing, or other mediums, is a deeply fulfilling and invigorating experience. 
        Each project allows me to explore new ideas and express myself in unique ways. 
        When I’m drawing or building a Gundam model set, I lose myself in the details and precision, finding a sense of peace and focus. 
        Writing, especially world building, lets my imagination run wild as I create intricate stories and universes. 
        These projects are more than just hobbies; they are a way for me to channel my creativity, challenge myself, and bring my visions to life. 
        The sense of accomplishment I feel upon completing a project is unmatched, and it fuels my passion to start the next one. Listed Below will be recordings of such projects.

      <h3>Journal</h3>
      <p>
        This is a journal taking page where key jurnal inquires which I want to show to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, journal and note-making have become invaluable practices that enhance my learning, creativity, and personal growth. 
        Keeping a journal allows me to reflect on my thoughts and emotions, document daily experiences, and track my personal development over time. 
        It's a way for me to process what’s happening in my life and gain insights into my own patterns and behaviors. 
        Note-making, on the other hand, helps me organize and retain information, whether it’s for college, work, or personal projects. 
        I’ve found that summarizing key points, creating mind maps, and using bullet points greatly improve my understanding and recall. 
        These practices encourage me to stay mindful, boost my productivity, and serve as a repository of ideas and knowledge that I can revisit and build upon.
        All inquires below are general information from my personal journal.
